# CS-300
Hello! This repository is for my SNHU course, CS-300.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For the projects in this course, the first problem I had to solve was to determine whether a vector, array, hash table, or BST was best for creating a university course planner using pseudocode. For project two, I had to create code to sort the courses in alphanumeric order, then create a menu and code in which the user could load the course list, print the full course list, or print a single course and its corresponding prerequisites.


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

First, I analyzed each process to see what the better data structure is. Next, I analyzed the runtime to determine the most advantageous process. Using pseudocode, I determined which data structure would be best, remembering that trees and hash tables are best for sorted items, while arrays and vectors work well for sequential items.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

My biggest roadblock came when trying to run my code with the course/prerequisite file. I kept getting an unhandled excpetion when trying to run the code. After much research online, I found that I had loaded the course file incorrectly. When I fixed this, everything worked perfectly.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has really helped me to understand which type of data structure to use for certain situations. In the future, I will be able to use this knowledge to develop programs that require sorted and unsorted lists.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has shown me that using pseudocode to drive my creations is essential. It provides a framework for creating workable code. Additionally, I have learned that I need to comment better on my code to make it more readable and adaptable for others.
